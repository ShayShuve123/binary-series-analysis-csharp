# C# Binary and Number Analysis Project
## Overview

This project implements five distinct exercises that focus on analyzing binary numbers and number sequences. The main functionalities of each exercise are as follows:

### Exercise 1: Binary Series Analysis

This exercise receives three 7-digit binary numbers from the user. The program:
- Converts each binary number to decimal.
- Displays the decimal numbers in descending order.
- Calculates the average of the decimal numbers.
- Identifies the longest sequence of consecutive identical bits (either `0`s or `1`s).
- Determines how many of the binary numbers are palindromes.
- Find the binary number with the highest number of `1`s and the lowest number of `0`s.

### Exercise 2: Binary to Decimal Conversion

This exercise focuses on the conversion of binary numbers to decimal. The user inputs a binary number, and the program manually converts it to decimal using bit manipulation (without using built-in functions).

### Exercise 3: Sequence Analysis

In this exercise, the program analyzes a series of numbers provided by the user. The following tasks are performed:
- Checks whether each number is a power of two.
- Sorts the numbers in ascending order.
- Identifies how many of the numbers form strictly increasing sequences.

### Exercise 4: Statistical Number Analysis

This exercise focuses on basic statistical analysis. The program:
- Calculates the average of the numbers provided by the user.
- Find the highest and lowest numbers.
- Determines the median of the set of numbers.

### Exercise 5: Palindrome and Sequence Identification

This exercise checks if binary numbers provided by the user are palindromes and prints the number of palindromes in the input. The program also:
- Displays the palindromes in the same line alongside the count.

## Requirements

- .NET Core SDK (version 5.0 or higher).
- Visual Studio 2022 or another compatible IDE for building and running C# applications.


The Ascending Order Is: 120, 85, 65
