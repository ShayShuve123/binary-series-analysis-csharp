C# Binary and Number Analysis Project

Overview
This project implements five distinct exercises that focus on binary numbers, conversions to decimal, statistical analysis, and properties of sequences of numbers.

Exercise 1: Binary Series Analysis
This exercise receives three 7-digit binary numbers from the user. The program:

Converts each binary number to decimal.
Displays the decimal numbers in descending order.
Calculates and prints the average of the decimal numbers.
Identifies the longest sequence of consecutive identical bits (either 0s or 1s).
Determines how many of the binary numbers are palindromes.
Finds the binary number with the highest number of 1s and the lowest number of 0s.
Exercise 2: Binary to Decimal Conversion
In this exercise, the program converts binary numbers to decimal values. The user inputs a binary number, and the program performs the conversion using manual bit manipulation (without built-in functions).

Exercise 3: Sequence Analysis
This exercise focuses on analyzing sequences of numbers. The user inputs a list of numbers, and the program performs the following operations:

Identifies if each number is a power of two.
Sorts the numbers in ascending order.
Determines how many of the numbers are strictly increasing.
Exercise 4: Statistical Number Analysis
The program receives a set of numbers from the user and provides the following statistical insights:

Calculates the average of the numbers.
Finds the highest and lowest numbers in the set.
Determines the median of the numbers.
Exercise 5: Palindrome and Sequence Identification
This exercise focuses on identifying palindromes in a series of binary numbers. The program:

Checks each binary number to see if it reads the same backward as forward.
Displays the count of palindrome numbers.
Prints the palindromes alongside the count in a single line.
